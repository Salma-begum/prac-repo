Now you need to do a little bit of setup in the app that you are working with.
You will need to modify your bower.json to use components/ember#canary 
for Ember.js and then link it to the local repository you just cloned.
I recommend you do this in a seperate terminal window/tab,
as you will have to go back and forth between this and the other a few times.
